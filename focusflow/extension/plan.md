// so the plan is as follows

the activity chrome extension exists

we can tell what site users are on, and can track the time spent at each of those sites

we need to maintain that information somewhere, somehow. a list of timestamps in a file is one way 

however we can also maintain overall time spent per day in a dict like format. we would create an other category for small percentage. 

now the data is sitting locally on our js file. how often do we send data to our local backend?
