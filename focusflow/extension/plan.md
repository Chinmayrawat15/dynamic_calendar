BUGS

Dynamically updating theh windoiw -> when new task started / paused. Timers for single sites not updating dyanmically

when u resume a task while a task is still going on, it accidently removes the current task instead of pausing

i want to move the active task green UI to the top

I dont want chrome notifs on hitting certain actions (delete)

FEATURE (dont do, firrst focus on bugs)

dont count moving back to most active tab as a tabswitch increase. 

timer-window (we will work on this at the end)
